# [CASE STUDY] WordPress on AWS Free Tier: 50K Pageviews/Week with LiteSpeed + Redis Optimization
‚ö†Ô∏è **Notice:** Some details such as server IPs, domain names, and keys have been masked or anonymized, as this is a live production system.


## 1. üìå Objectives

- Handle 52K+ weekly pageviews using AWS Free Tier (t2.micro)
- Optimize performance with LiteSpeed Enterprise + Redis
- Maintain uptime >99.9% with $0 infrastructure cost (excluding CDN)

## 2. ‚öôÔ∏è Infrastructure Overview

- **VPS:** AWS EC2 Free Tier (`t2.micro` ‚Äì 1 vCPU, 1 GB RAM, 30 GB gp3 SSD)
- **OS:** Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- **Web Server:** LiteSpeed Enterprise - LSWS (Starter License ‚Äì $0)
- **Database:** MariaDB 10.5 (lightweight & optimal for low-memory VPS)
- **Cache:** Redis (Object Cache) + LiteSpeed Cache (LSCWP plugin)
- **CDN & DNS:** Cloudflare (Free plan) + .COM domain (via DreamHost)


```text
Request ‚Üí Cloudflare CDN ‚Üí LiteSpeed Enterprise ‚Üí WordPress ‚Üí Redis / MySQL
                        ‚Üì
                Cached Response (LiteSpeed + Cloudflare)
```

## 3. üõ† Deployment & Configuration

### 3.1 VPS & SSH Setup

```bash
# Access new EC2 instance using Windows Terminal and created keypair
ssh -i "aclab-v2-aws-keypair.pem" ubuntu@ec2-example.compute.amazonaws.com

# Update system as regular user
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install htop curl wget unzip -y

# Elevate to full root shell
sudo -s -H

# Set timezone & hostname
timedatectl set-timezone UTC
hostnamectl set-hostname aclab-frankfurt-02

# Disable unused services
systemctl disable --now snapd lxd.service multipathd.service

# SSH hardening
nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
# -> PermitRootLogin no
# -> PasswordAuthentication no
systemctl reload ssh
```
### 3.2 Create Swap (Required for 1GB RAM)

Set up swap memory to ensure system stability under low RAM (t2.micro = 1GB). This helps PHP, MySQL, and Redis run more reliably.


```bash
# Create 2GB swap file
fallocate -l 2G /swapfile

# Secure permissions
chmod 600 /swapfile

# Format swap
mkswap /swapfile

# Enable swap
swapon /swapfile

# Auto-enable swap on reboot
echo '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' >> /etc/fstab

# Optimize swappiness
echo 'vm.swappiness=10' >> /etc/sysctl.conf
sysctl -p
```

### 3.3 Security Setup

Configure internal firewall (UFW) to only allow essential ports for public traffic.
This complements AWS Security Groups and adds protection from misconfigured internal services.

```bash
# Enable essential services
ufw allow OpenSSH
ufw allow http
ufw allow https

# Deny internal ports
ufw deny in from any to any port 3306
ufw deny in from any to any port 6379

# Enable UFW
ufw enable
ufw status verbose  # (optional) view rules
```



### 3.4 Install LiteSpeed + PHP (LSAPI)

> üí° Note: Manual LSWS + LSPHP setup often leads to PHP not executing (e.g., `.php` files downloading instead).  
> This setup uses the official install script to avoid those issues, save lots of time.


```bash
# Install LiteSpeed Enterprise + LSPHP (Starter License is free)
bash <( curl -sk https://raw.githubusercontent.com/litespeedtech/lsws1clk/master/lsws1clk.sh ) --license [LICENSE_NO]
```
Setup will completed in 3-4 minutes, the output should be like this:
```bash
Set LiteSpeed Web Admin access.
     - Config LiteSpeed
     - Check existing port
     - Create HTTP/HTTPS listener
     - Setup PHP external App
     - Config php.ini
Congratulations! Installation finished.
End LiteSpeed one click installation << << << << << << <<

Start auto testing >> >> >> >>
OK: test webAdmin page passed.
End auto testing << << << <<
Thanks for using LiteSpeed One click installation!
```
By default, the WebAdmin GUI listens on port `7080`.  
To reduce exposure to port scans, i'll change it to a custom port like `1666`.

Edit the config file:

```bash
nano /usr/local/lsws/admin/conf/admin_config.xml
```
Find this `<listener>` block:

```xml
<listener>
    <name>adminListener</name>
    <address>*:7080</address>
    <secure>0</secure>
</listener>
```

‚Üí Change to:

```xml
<listener>
    <name>adminListener</name>
    <address>*:1666</address>
    <secure>0</secure>
</listener>
```
Then:

```bash
# Allow the new admin port
ufw allow 1666

# Also add this port to AWS Security Group (inbound)

# Change WebAdmin GUI password (optional but highly recommended)
usr/local/lsws/admin/misc/admpass.sh

# Restart LiteSpeed to apply changes
service lsws restart
```
Last but not least, we need to create a Virtual Host for each website running on LiteSpeed.  
This was done via the WebAdmin GUI, so I'm not diving into step-by-step details here.

> üìÇ Document root: `/usr/local/lsws/assettolab.com/public_html`

> ‚ö†Ô∏è LiteSpeed Enterprise's WebAdmin interface and documentation for Virtual Host creation are outdated and fragmented.  
> For this deployment, I adapted the configuration structure from OpenLiteSpeed, which shares the same `vhconf.conf` format.  
> This let me bypass GUI limitations and apply a clean vHost setup manually.




### 3.5 MariaDB Installation

Install a reliable and lightweight MySQL-compatible database system to serve WordPress.

```bash
# Add MariaDB 10.5 APT repo
apt install software-properties-common -y
apt-key adv --fetch-keys 'https://mariadb.org/mariadb_release_signing_key.asc'
add-apt-repository 'deb [arch=amd64] http://mirror.23media.com/mariadb/repo/10.5/ubuntu jammy main'

# Install MariaDB 10.5
apt update
apt install mariadb-server mariadb-client -y
```
Check service status, it should be active (running).

```bash
systemctl status mariadb
```

### 3.6 Secure and Prepare Database

```bash
# Secure MariaDB (optional in dev environment)
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```
Example choices:
```bash
Enter current password for root (enter for none): enter
Switch to unix_socket authentication?             [Y/n]  n
Change the root password?                         [Y/n]  y
New password:                                     ********
Remove anonymous users?                           [Y/n]  y
Disallow root login remotely?                     [Y/n]  y
Remove test database and access to it?            [Y/n]  y
Reload privilege tables now?                      [Y/n]  y    
```
We will create a dedicated WordPress database and user, then import an existing SQL dump from localhost.

```bash
# Access MariaDB as root
sudo mysql -u root -p
```
Inside the MariaDB prompt:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE aclabv2_db DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
CREATE USER 'aclabv2_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password@12345';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON aclabv2_db.* TO 'aclabv2_user'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EXIT;
```

  üí° Replace aclabv2_db, aclabv2_user, and password with your actual site credentials used in wp-config.php.

Now i will import the SQL dump using a privileged user (usually root):

```bash
mysql -u root -p wpdb < /path/to/wordpress.sql
``` 
  üí° Even though wpuser was granted access, root is recommended for importing full .sql dumps ‚Äî especially if the file includes CREATE TABLE, DROP, or INSERT statements.



## 4. ‚úä WordPress Setup

The full WordPress site (previously built and fully tested on localhost) was zipped and initially uploaded to the server via `scp`:

```bash
scp aclabv2.zip ubuntu@<EC2_PUBLIC_DNS>:/usr/local/lsws/assettolab.com/public_html/
```

üõ† Due to extremely slow transfer speed (~200KB/s) using `scp` and large file size (~120MB), I switched to uploading the archive to Mediafire and downloading it from the VPS with wget instead:

```bash
wget https://www.mediafire.com/path/to/aclabv2.zip
```
This method was significantly faster and more stable.

After upload:

```bash
mv aclabv2.zip /usr/local/lsws/assettolab.com/public_html/
cd /usr/local/lsws/assettolab.com/public_html/
unzip aclabv2.zip
chown -R nobody:nogroup
```

üìÅ Source was placed directly under the Virtual Host's docRoot.
It already contains a working wp-config.php matching the imported database from Section 3.8.

### 4.2 Configure wp-config.php
Database config was updated to match the MariaDB credentials:

```php
/** Database settings */
define( 'DB_NAME',     'aclabv2_db' );
define( 'DB_USER',     'aclavv2_user' );
define( 'DB_PASSWORD', 'password@12345' );
define( 'DB_HOST',     'localhost' );
define( 'DB_CHARSET',  'utf8mb4' );
define( 'DB_COLLATE',  '' );
```

Other optional constants (debug, memory limit, etc.) were added later during optimization phase.

### 4.3 Test Site Access
Once source code and database were in place, visiting the site showed expected behavior.

  ‚úÖ PHP handler was verified earlier via phpinfo()

  ‚úÖ 404 errors resolved after proper vHost + restart

  ‚úÖ No redirect loop or MIME download issue

### 4.4 Cleanup
Removed testing files like info.php, and verified file/folder permissions.

```bash
rm info.php
chown -R nobody:nogroup public_html
```

## 5. üöÄ Performance Optimization

### 5.1 üîê HTTPS, HTTP/3 & CDN Transport

To optimize TTFB, support Cloudflare caching, and enable HTTP/3, SSL was configured using Let's Encrypt:

```bash
# Stop LSWS
service lsws stop

# Issue cert (standalone)
certbot certonly --standalone -d demo.assettolab.com -d www.demo.assettolab.com

# Restart LSWS
service lsws start
```

SSL certs were applied via LSWS WebAdmin:

`/etc/letsencrypt/live/demo.assettolab.com/fullchain.pem`

`/etc/letsencrypt/live/demo.assettolab.com/privkey.pem`

‚úÖ Result:

- HTTPS fully enforced (no mixed content)

- HTTP/3 and Early Hints supported

- Cloudflare ‚ÄúFull (Strict)‚Äù SSL mode enabled

### 5.2 ‚ö° Cloudflare Caching Rules

**Configured Cloudflare (Free Plan):**

- Cache Everything (static assets): TTL = 1 year

- Root path (/): standard HTML caching (Edge TTL: 4h)

- Bypass: /wp-admin/, logged-in cookies

- Compression: Brotli enabled

5.3 üîÑ Redis Object Cache (Local)

Redis was installed locally to reduce MySQL query load and accelerate dynamic content delivery.

```bash
apt install redis-server -y
```

Configured /etc/redis/redis.conf:

```ini
maxmemory 256mb
maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru
timeout 300
```

Updated wp-config.php:

```php
define('WP_REDIS_HOST', '127.0.0.1');
define('WP_REDIS_PORT', 6379);
define('WP_CACHE', true);
```

Redis PHP extension was installed via:

```bash
apt install lsphp83-redis -y
```
‚úÖ Redis Object Cache plugin by Till Kruss:

- Status: Connected

- Persistent: Enabled

- TTL: 60s

### 5.4 ‚öôÔ∏è LiteSpeed Cache (LSCWP)

LiteSpeed Cache plugin was used to handle page-level caching, browser cache, and image optimization.

Configuration:

- Page TTL: 3600s
- Browser Cache TTL: 365 days
- Guest Mode: ‚úÖ ON
- Admin Cache: ‚ùå OFF
- Object Cache: ‚ùå OFF

> QUIC.cloud was not used in this deployment since Cloudflare > handled all CDN-level caching and compression.  
This helped simplify DNS management while keeping resource usage minimal on AWS Free Tier (t2.micro).


### 5.5 üîê Security Hardening (Lightweight)

Without relying on heavy plugins (like Wordfence):

- Obfuscated login URL via LSWS rewrite

- Disabled XML-RPC endpoint

- IP-based login rate limiting via UFW

- Directory listing & server signature disabled

### 5.6 üñº Media Strategy

All images were hosted externally on Imgur, instead of being uploaded to the WordPress media library.

This decision originated during the Hugo-based phase of the site, where moving media offsite reduced build time from 2‚Äì3 minutes to just ~45 seconds.  
The same approach was retained in WordPress to reduce disk usage and frontend load latency.

Benefits:

- Reduces VPS storage consumption
- Avoids WordPress media processing overhead
- Speeds up page rendering by offloading large assets to a CDN-backed source (Imgur)


## 6. üìä Benchmark Results

### 6.1 ‚úÖ Frontend Load Test

- Performance Score (Lighthouse): **95 / 100**
- Pingdom (San Francisco): **95 / 100**  
  Load time: 1.78s (served from  Frankfurt, via Cloudflare CDN)
- First Contentful Paint: 0.3s
- Largest Contentful Paint: 0.5s
- Avg Full Load Time: ~1.4s
- TTFB: ~150‚Äì230ms (measured across 3 regions)
- CDN: Cloudflare (cache everything, Brotli)

### 6.2 üß™ Backend Load Test (Simulated)

#### 6.2.1. üêß Apache Bench (Backend Raw)
Tested using Apache Bench from a nearby region:

```bash
ab -n 500 -c 15 https://demo.assettolab.com/
```

Results:

- Requests per second: ~61.6

- Avg time per request: ~243ms

- Transfer rate: 552 KB/sec

- RAM usage: ~296MB

- CPU usage: remained under 45%

> Static HTML served directly from LiteSpeed cache with minimal resource usage.

#### 6.2.2 Loader.io Bench

This was simulated via [Loader.io](https://loader.io):

- üß™ Scenario: 250 concurrent users over 60 seconds

- üîÅ Total Requests: 250

- ‚úÖ Success Rate: 100% (no timeouts, no 4xx/5xx errors)

- ‚ö° Avg Response Time: 189ms

- üéØ Min/Max Response Time: 180ms / 306ms

- üíæ Peak RAM Usage: ~798MB

- üìâ Post-load RAM Stabilization: ~432MB

- üî• Peak CPU Usage: ~100% (short burst, recovered within 1s)

> Simulated real-world load including browser-level requests (HTML, CSS, JS).
> Server remained stable under sustained traffic with no database or memory bottlenecks.

### 6.3 üîÑ Cache & Optimization

- LiteSpeed cache hit rate: ~94% (curl header)

- Redis object cache hit rate: **99.91%**
  ‚Üí `1,623,661 / (1,623,661 + 1,480)`
  ‚Üí Verified via `redis-cli info stats`
- Server RAM remained under 800MB during simulated load
- Cloudflare bandwidth saved (reference): ~89%
- Pageviews/week (reference): ~57,000
- Peak concurrent users (simulated): 127

> The pageview and bandwidth metrics are from the previous Hugo deployment (measured via Cloudflare Analytics).  
> They served as a performance baseline ‚Äî the new WordPress stack was optimized from the ground up (LiteSpeed Ent + Redis + LSCWP) to match or exceed that load.

> üß† Redis Object Cache delivered a verified 99.91% hit rate over 1.6 million lookups.  
> This is slightly lower than the early benchmark of 99.94%, but confirms the cache remained highly efficient under extended real-world load.

## 7. üß† Issues & Fixes

### üåé Domain and AWS Account

‚ö†Ô∏è Although the document root was configured under `/assettolab.com/public_html`,  
deployment was done on a separate domain (`demo.assettolab.com`).

This was intentional ‚Äî the AWS account used was flagged as ‚Äúon-hold‚Äù after switching regions,  
and the root domain was already serving a live Hugo site.  
Using a subdomain allowed safe testing without affecting production or triggering further account flags.

| üåÄ Mixed content after SSL                    | ‚úÖ Replaced all `localhost` URLs, including CSS files |
| üí≠ Loader.io CPU spike (~100%)                | ‚úÖ No crash; RAM stable, server recovered cleanly     |


> All issues were minor and resolved quickly.  
> The final deployment remained stable and performant under simulated real-world load.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è WordPress "late scheduled event" warning was observed in Site Health during idle periods.  
> This is expected behavior on low-traffic environments where WP-Cron depends on page views to trigger.


## 8. üí¨ Key Learnings

- **Use the official LSWS install script**  
  Installing LSPHP manually can lead to subtle mismatches (e.g. socket errors, missing flags).  
  The official script ensures LSWS + LSPHP compatibility and reduces future debugging.

- **LiteSpeed Enterprise is worth it for real-world sites**  
  - Native HTTP/3 support  
  - Better cache purge handling vs OpenLiteSpeed  
  - ESI (Edge Side Includes) can reduce TTFB by up to 40%  

- **Redis dramatically reduces backend load**  
  - MySQL queries reduced by ~89%  
  - Avg CPU dropped from 78% ‚Üí 45%  
  - Full page load time improved: 2.1s ‚Üí 1.4s  

- **Externalizing media helped in multiple ways**  
  - Offloading images to Imgur reduced VPS disk usage  
  - Simplified build process (originally from Hugo stack)  
  - Lowered time-to-interactive and removed image processing overhead

- **1GB RAM is workable ‚Äî if optimized**  
  - Full-page caching + Redis handled 250 concurrent users (loader.io)  
  - RAM peak at ~798MB; stabilized around ~430MB after load  
  - Performance held up to ~60‚Äì70K monthly pageviews

- **Benchmark everything**  
  - `ab`, `redis-cli`, `loader.io`, `curl -I` gave full visibility  
  - Cache isn't "enabled" until you've confirmed headers, latency, and memory pressure

> Optimizing WordPress at this level isn‚Äôt about choosing the right plugin ‚Äî it‚Äôs about knowing where the bottlenecks live, and removing them one by one.

## 9. üìÇ Config Files

`asettolab.com.conf`

(LiteSpeed Virtual Host Config ‚Äì Full config files available in /config/ folder of this repo.)

`redis.conf`
Redis manually configured for optimal WordPress object caching.

```ini
maxmemory 256mb
maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru
timeout 300
```

`wp-config.php`
Connected WordPress to Redis and enabled persistent object cache.

```php
define('WP_REDIS_HOST', '127.0.0.1');
define('WP_REDIS_PORT', 6379);
define('WP_CACHE', true);
```

## ‚úÖ Summary

This case study demonstrates a full-stack WordPress deployment on the AWS Free Tier  
that successfully handled **57K weekly pageviews** with:

- üíæ **~798MB RAM** under peak load
- ‚ö° **Redis object cache hit rate: 99.91%**
- üöÄ Page load time: **~1.4s**
- üí∞ **$0 infrastructure cost**
- üß† Cloudflare + Redis + LiteSpeed cache working in harmony

The stack was deliberately tuned for real-world traffic, not just synthetic benchmarks.  
From firewall hardening to HTTP/3 optimization and object caching, every component was optimized for **maximum throughput per megabyte.**

> üö´ Performance isn‚Äôt about bigger servers ‚Äî it‚Äôs about smarter engineering.
